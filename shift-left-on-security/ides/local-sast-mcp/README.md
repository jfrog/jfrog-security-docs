The JFrog Local SAST MCP is a tool that integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible AI assistants, such as GitHub Copilot or Cursor IDE. It uses the JFrog SAST engine to scan the entire codebase, analyze code semantics, and detect SAST vulnerabilities. The tool provides the AI assistant with immediate access to various aspects of the source code, such as security vulnerabilities and other security-related features. This is performed by reading and analyzing the code using the JFrog SAST source code analysis engine. It also supports capabilities like identifying and fixing vulnerabilities and detecting code duplication. The entire process runs locally, ensuring your source code never leaves your network. This is a key advantage for companies with strict security and privacy requirements.
