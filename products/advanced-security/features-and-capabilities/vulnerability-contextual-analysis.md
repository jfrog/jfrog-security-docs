# Vulnerability Contextual Analysis

JFrog Security and the JFrog research team continuously strive to enhance security. As part of this effort, we are introducing **Vulnerability Contextual Analysis**, an extension of JFrog Xray’s **CVE Research and Enrichment** feature. This new capability helps prioritize vulnerabilities, allowing you to focus on the most critical issues while efficiently allocating resources for remediation.

## Prerequisites

* **JFrog Xray Installed & Configured** – Ensure Xray is properly set up to scan repositories and artifacts.
* **Supported Xray Version** – Some features require Xray **3.77.4 or later**.
* **Access to Repositories** – Permissions to scan Docker, Maven, or Gradle repositories.
* **Containerized Environment** – Certain analysis features apply specifically to containers.
* **Basic CVE Knowledge** – Understanding of vulnerability scanning and CVE impact.

## The Challenge

When JFrog Xray scans your packages, it can detect thousands of vulnerabilities. Developers must then sift through extensive lists to determine which vulnerabilities are relevant, a process that can be both time-consuming and error-prone. In many cases, vulnerabilities may not even impact your artifacts, making it difficult to know where to start.

## The Solution

**Vulnerability Contextual Analysis** leverages artifact context to eliminate false positives, ensuring that only relevant vulnerabilities are flagged. This is achieved through automated scanners that analyze containerized environments, identifying reachable paths for detected vulnerabilities.

Xray automatically validates high and very high-impact vulnerabilities, including those requiring specific conditions for exploitation. It then provides **contextual analysis information**, helping you determine which vulnerabilities are applicable to a specific artifact.

## Key Benefits

* **Real-world risk assessment:** Analyzes finished code from an attacker's perspective, identifying which issues are truly exploitable and their potential impact.
* **Context-aware testing:** Assesses vulnerabilities in the context of the complete artifact, build, or Release Bundle.
* **Actionable remediation:** Enables targeted mitigation based on the actual artifact, build, or Release Bundle.

* **Rust binaries in Docker containers**: Supported in Xray **3.79.x and later**
* **.NET binaries in Docker containers**: Supported in Xray **3.95.4 and later**

## Contextual Analysis Statuses and Results

Once an artifact is indexed in Xray as part of a single upload, build, or Release Bundle, Xray will validate if the artifact contains vulnerabilities that are considered to have a very high impact. If such vulnerabilities are found, Xray will run the contextual analysis and retrieve the contextual analysis results. The results consist of the following:

**Vulnerability Contextual Analysis Statuses**

* **Not Scanned**: Initial state, the scan wasn't invoked for the CVE.
* **Applicable**: The vulnerability can be exploited in the context of the scanned artifact.
* **Not Applicable**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited in the context of the scanned artifact.
* **Undetermined:** The applicability cannot be determined by static analysis (e.g. the exploitation requires user interaction).
* **Rescan Required**: A new scanner for this CVE is available, you need to rescan to retrieve applicability results.
* **Upgrade Required**: (Self-Hosted only) The Xray version needs to be updated to receive a new scanner for this CVE. Rescan is required after the upgrade.
* **Not Covered**: Scanner isn't available.
* **Technology Unsupported**: The vulnerability’s package type is currently not supported.
* **Missing Context**: Reachability analysis cannot determine the vulnerability’s applicability. Applicability can be determined by scanning the artifact in a Docker repository in the JFrog Platform.

**Vulnerability Contextual Analysis Results**

The contextual analysis results can be accessed from [Scans List](https://about/document/preview/551896#UUID-82a35411-384b-423c-8aba-0b6796583862).
