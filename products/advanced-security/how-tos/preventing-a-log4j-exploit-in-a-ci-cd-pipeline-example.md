# Preventing a Log4j Exploit in a CI/CD Pipeline (example)

**Scenario:**

A DevOps team at a financial services company is building a Java-based microservices application. Their CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process, using multiple open-source libraries.

One day, a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228, known as **Log4Shell**) is discovered in **Log4j**, a widely used logging library. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute remote code on vulnerable servers, leading to data breaches or system compromise.

#### **How JFrog Advanced Security Mitigates the Risk**

**1. Detection in Artifactory (Artifact Repository Security)**

* JFrog **Xray** continuously scans all dependencies stored in **JFrog Artifactory**.
* It immediately detects the Log4j vulnerability in a newly built artifact.
* Developers receive an alert with details on the affected version and remediation steps.

**2. Prevention in CI/CD Pipeline (Shift-Left Security)**

* The team has security policies configured to **block builds** containing critical vulnerabilities.
* When the CI/CD pipeline runs, JFrog Advanced Security scans the build and **automatically fails the pipeline** if Log4j is detected.
* Developers are notified in their DevOps tools (e.g., Slack, Jira, or email) and can quickly upgrade to a secure version.

**3. Real-Time Threat Intelligence (Zero-Day Protection)**

* JFrog continuously updates its vulnerability database.
* Even if the application had passed previous scans, JFrog Advanced Security **retroactively scans stored artifacts** when a new CVE is discovered.
* If Log4j is found in **already deployed** applications, the security team is alerted to take immediate action.

**4. Runtime Monitoring & Compliance**

* The DevOps team uses JFrogâ€™s integration with Kubernetes to monitor **running containers** for Log4j vulnerabilities.
* If an insecure version is detected in production, they trigger an **automated rollback** to a secure image.
* Audit reports help the organization maintain compliance with security regulations (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).
