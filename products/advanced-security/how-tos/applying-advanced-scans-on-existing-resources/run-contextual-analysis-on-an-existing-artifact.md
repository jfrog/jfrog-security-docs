# Run Contextual Analysis on an Existing Artifact

Starting from Xray version 3.66.x and above, you can run contextual analysis on an existing artifact. Do the following:

1. From the **Scans List** page, **Repositories** tab, select the repository.
2. Navigate to the artifact you want.
3. Click the Actions Menu next to the artifact, and select **Run Contextual Analysis**.

The results appear under **Security Issues** > **Vulnerabilities**.
