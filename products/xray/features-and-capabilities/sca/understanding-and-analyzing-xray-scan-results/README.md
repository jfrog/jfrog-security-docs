# Understanding and Analyzing Xray Scan Results

### **Overview**

Xray scans your artifacts, builds, and Release Bundles for vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and operational risks. Once a scan is completed, Xray provides a detailed report with identified issues, their severity, affected components, and possible remediation steps.

This guide will help you navigate, interpret, and act upon scan results effectively.

### **Where to Find Xray Scan Results?**

Xray scan results can be accessed in **multiple locations** depending on the scope of the scan:

#### &#x20;**Viewing Scan Results**

* Navigate to **Application -> Xray -> Scan List**.
* Select the **resource (**&#x47;it Repositories, Repositories, Builds, Release Bundles, Packages)&#x20;
* Click on the specific resource and select the particular version you want to analyze.

### **Understanding Xray Scan Results**

#### **1. Overview of the Scan Summary**

The **Xray Scan Dashboard** provides a high-level summary of issues found in the scanned entity. It includes:

* **General Scan Data** (Last scan date, downloads, etc.)
* **Total Number of Vulnerabilities** **by Severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* **Total Number of Policy Violations** **by Severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* **Type of Policy Violations** (Security, License, or Operational).
* **SBOM Details** (Most common package types, most common licenses, etc.)

#### **2. Policy Violations Tab**

This tab displays all detected **violations** affecting your scanned resource.

**Examples of Recommended Actions:**

* If a fix is available for a security violation, upgrade the component to the suggested fix version.
* If a violation is failing your build and you need a grace period, request an ignore rule with an expiration date from the security team.&#x20;
* If it’s a false positive, request an ignore rule from the security team.

#### **3. SBOM Tab**

This tab provides a list of components and licenses associated with the scanned resource. Identifies the component list, their versions, their licenses, and operational risk data.&#x20;

**Examples of** **Recommended Actions:**

* Identify a risky component in your resource.&#x20;
* For restricted licenses: Obtain legal approval or find an alternative package.
* For missing licenses: Ensure the package includes a valid license declaration.
* Identify which component is end-of-life and other operational risk information.&#x20;

#### **4. Security Issues Tab ( Vulnerabilities and Malicious Packages)**

The Vulnerabilities section displays detected vulnerabilities that affect the scanned resource including additional information on each vulnerability.&#x20;

**Examples of** **Recommended Actions:**

* If a fix is available for a vulnerability, upgrade the component to the suggested fix version.
* Use the enriched data provided by the JFrog Research Team to understand the exploitability of the vulnerability.&#x20;
* Understand which component version is vulnerable and what is the exact vulnerable path.

### **Filtering and Sorting Scan Results for Better Analysis**

Xray provides **filters** to help narrow down scan results for better prioritization.

#### **1. Filter by Severity**

* **Critical & High**: Prioritize immediate remediation.
* **Medium & Low**: Monitor but don’t necessarily block deployment.

#### **2. Filter by Component Name**

Search for vulnerabilities affecting a specific package (e.g., `log4j`).

#### **3. Filter by Policy Violations**

* Show only vulnerabilities that violate predefined security policies.

### **Taking Action on Scan Results**

#### **1. Fixing Vulnerabilities**

* Upgrade vulnerable dependencies if a fix is available.
* Apply security patches if upgrading is not feasible.
* Request an exception for false positives or justified risks.

#### **2. Handling License Issues**

* Replace restricted licenses with compliant alternatives.
* Obtain legal approvals for specific cases.

#### **3. Exporting and Sharing Reports**

* Click "Export Report" → Select format CSV, JSON, or PDF.
* Share with security, DevOps, and compliance teams for risk assessment.
