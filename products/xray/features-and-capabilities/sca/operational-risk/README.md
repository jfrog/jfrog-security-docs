# Operational Risk

Beyond security vulnerabilities and compliance issues, **operational risks** in software components can impact system reliability, maintainability, and overall software quality. These risks arise from **outdated, deprecated, or unmaintained dependencies** that may no longer receive updates, security patches, or community support.

JFrog Xray provides **Operational Risk Analysis**, enabling organizations to detect and mitigate risks **before they affect production environments**. By identifying software components with **end-of-life (EOL) statuses, deprecated libraries, and maintenance concerns**, teams can make informed decisions to maintain **software stability and long-term viability**.

### **What is Operational Risk in Software?**

Operational risk refers to **non-security-related issues** that can affect a software component’s **performance, reliability, or maintainability**.

Common operational risks include:\
**End-of-Life (EOL) Software** – Components that **no longer receive updates or security patches**.\
**Deprecated Dependencies** – Libraries marked **as obsolete or replaced** by newer versions.\
**Unmaintained Open-Source Projects** – Software that **hasn’t been updated for a long period**, increasing the risk of compatibility issues.\
**High-Impact Component Updates** – Major version changes that introduce **breaking changes or API modifications**.\
**Abandoned Projects** – Open-source components with **no active contributors or maintainers**.

***

### **How Xray Detects Operational Risks**

Xray continuously monitors software components in **repositories, builds, and release bundles**, identifying key operational risks based on:

**Version Stability** – Detects if a component **hasn’t been updated for an extended period**.\
**End-of-Life Status** – Flags software that has reached **EOL and no longer receives support**.\
**Community and Maintenance Health** – Analyzes **activity levels** of open-source maintainers.\
**API and Compatibility Changes** – Identifies **major version changes** that may introduce **breaking updates**.\
**License Status Changes** – Notifies teams when **license modifications impact compliance**.

### Operational Risk Workflow in Xray

1. Create Operational Risk Policy.
2. Attach Policy to Watch.
3. View Operational Risk Data in the Xray Data tab in Artifactory.
4. View Operational Risk violations generated based on the Policy rules you set

### **Mitigating Operational Risks with Xray**

#### **1. Monitor Dependencies Continuously**

* Apply **Operational Risk Policies** to repositories and builds.
* Detect **outdated and deprecated** dependencies **before they impact production**.

#### **2. Enforce Governance in CI/CD Pipelines**

* Configure Xray to **fail builds** if they contain **high-risk operational components**.
* Require **dependency reviews** before promoting artifacts.

#### **3. Plan for End-of-Life Transitions**

* Track **EOL software** and migrate to **actively maintained alternatives**.
* Avoid dependencies that **lack long-term maintenance support**.

#### **4. Establish a Risk Management Strategy**

* Regularly **audit software dependencies** for **compatibility and lifecycle health**.
* Work with **open-source communities** to assess long-term viability.
