# Git Repository Configuration

To begin, an initial Frogbot scan must be executed. Scan results can then be viewed under **Xray â†’ Scan Results**, where it's also possible to configure Git repository scanners. Configuration settings defined in the Frogbot YAML file and environment variables take precedence over any settings applied through the platform.

### Configuring Git Repositories

1. Navigate to **Administration** > **Xray Settings** > **Indexed Resources**, and select the **Git Repositories** tab.
2. Select one or more Git Repositories.
3. From the actions menu, select **Configure**.\
   The **Scan Configurations** pop-up window opens.
4. Select one or more types of scans you wish to run on the selected Git Repositories:

* SCA
*   Advanced Security:

    * Vulnerabilities Contextual Analysis
    * IaC
    * Secrets
    * SAST

    (Optional: **Exclude Path,** using the following format: `**/*(venv,...,.venv)*`)

    (Optional for SAST only: [Exclude Rule](../../products/advanced-security/features-and-capabilities/sast/list-of-sast-rules.md))

5. Click **Apply**.\
   The **Folder** table opens, displaying the:&#x20;

* Folder names within the Git repository
* Number of folders within each folder
* Last time the folder was scanned
* Configuration source, which may be the Git repository configuration (**Inherited**) or the folder itself (**custom**).
