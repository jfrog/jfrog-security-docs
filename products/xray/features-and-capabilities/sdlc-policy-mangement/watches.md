# Watches in JFrog Xray

Security and compliance in modern software development require **continuous monitoring** of dependencies, builds, and repositories. JFrog Xray uses **Watches** as a powerful mechanism to **track, analyze, and enforce policies** on software artifacts throughout the development lifecycle.

By configuring Watches, organizations can **proactively detect security vulnerabilities, enforce compliance policies, and manage operational risks** across their entire **software supply chain**.

***

### **What Are Watches in Xray?**

A **Watch** in JFrog Xray is a **customizable security and compliance monitoring entity** that allows teams to track **specific repositories, builds, and release bundles**.

Watches enable:\
**Targeted Monitoring** – Focus on **specific artifacts, repositories, builds, or projects**.\
**Automated Security & Compliance** – Apply **predefined policies** to trigger violations.\
**Policy-Driven Governance** – Enforce **security, legal compliance, and operational risk policies**.\
**Proactive Threat Detection** – Identify **vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unapproved licenses** before they become a risk.

Instead of scanning **all artifacts globally**, Watches allow users to **define what to monitor and how to respond**.

***

### **How Watches Work in Xray**

#### **1. Define a Watch Scope**

Watches let you specify **which components to monitor** by selecting:

* **Repositories** – Scan artifacts stored in a specific Artifactory repository.
* **Builds** – Monitor artifacts produced by a specific CI/CD pipeline.
* **Release Bundles** – Track security and compliance of software **before distribution**.

This enables teams to apply different policies to different stages of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

***

#### **2. Apply Policies to the Watch**

Watches enforce **custom policies** based on organizational security and compliance needs.

**Common Policy Types Applied to Watches**

**Security Policies** – Detect and block **vulnerabilities** in open-source components.\
**Compliance Policies** – Ensure software components comply with **license requirements**.\
**Operational Risk Policies** – Identify outdated, deprecated, or unmaintained software components.

***

#### 3. Apply Watches on Existing Content

Once a **Watch** is created, it will scan artifacts in the specified resources when a scan-triggering event happens, and issue Violations accordingly. However, until a scan-triggering event happens, artifacts already existing in the system will not be scanned by the Watch. So, to make sure a Watch is immediately applied to the relevant artifacts, you can invoke it manually by hovering over it and selecting **Apply on Existing Content**.

Clicking the button pops up a dialog that lets you specify which of the resources assigned to the watch should be scanned, and a date range that defines when the artifact was last scanned by Xray.

For example, selecting **Last 7 days** will only scan artifacts that have been scanned in the last 7 days.

**Note**: **Not available for All Repositories or All Builds**

You can only manually invoke a Watch on existing content if the Watch is defined on specific resources and not on All Repositories or All Builds.&#x20;

***

#### 4. Examine Violations on a Watch

You can review and manage all the violations generated by a Watch under a central location **Application > Xray > Watch Violations** on an ongoing basis.&#x20;

You can view the list of the violations, search for violations according to filters, and set [ignore rules](ignore-rules.md).

***

### **Key Use Cases for Watches in Xray**

#### **1. Securing Repositories**

* Monitor **all artifacts** in a **production repository**.
* **Block downloads** of artifacts with **high-risk vulnerabilities**.
* **Detect malicious packages** in open-source dependencies

***

#### **2. Protecting CI/CD Pipelines**

* Scan **build artifacts** as part of **CI/CD workflows**.
* Fail builds **if security violations are detected**.
* Ensure software **meets compliance requirements** before promotion.

***

#### **3. Compliance and License Enforcement**

* Monitor repositories for **unauthorized open-source licenses**.
* Enforce **company-approved licensing policies**.
* Track **multi-license components** to ensure compliance.

***

#### **4. Release Validation Before Deployment**

* Scan **release bundles** before software distribution.
* Ensure artifacts are **free from security risks**.
* Validate software components **before production deployment**.
