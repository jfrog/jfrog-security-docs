# Advanced Security

**JFrog Advanced Security** is a robust security solution that protects software supply chains by providing **deep vulnerability analysis, exposure detection, and advanced threat intelligence**. Integrated with **JFrog Xray**, it enables developers and security teams to **identify, analyze, and remediate security risks** across the entire software development lifecycle.

### **Where Xray Fits in the JFrog Security Timeline**



## **Business Needs for JFrog Advanced Security**

**JFrog Advanced Security** addresses critical business needs by ensuring secure software development, supply chain protection, and regulatory compliance.

**Protecting the Software Supply Chain**

* Prevents **malicious code injection, dependency attacks, and misconfigurations** that could compromise the integrity of software.
* Identifies **vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies** before they become security risks.
* Ensures that all software artifacts are **secure from development to deployment**.

**Reducing Security Risks and False Positives**

* Uses **contextual analysis** to **eliminate false positives** and prioritize actual threats.
* Detects **secrets exposure (API keys, credentials, tokens) to prevent data leaks**.
* Scans for **insecure configurations** in applications, infrastructure, and services.

**Enforcing Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**

* Helps businesses adhere to **security standards like ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2, GDPR, and more**.
* Automates security policies to **enforce best practices and compliance** across development teams.
* Provides **audit trails and reporting** for security assessments and regulatory needs.

**Enhancing DevSecOps and CI/CD Pipelines**

* Seamlessly integrates into DevOps workflows, enabling **continuous security scanning** without slowing down development.
* Offers **REST APIs** for embedding security checks into CI/CD pipelines.
* Allows security teams to **define policies** that automatically enforce secure development practices.

**Improving Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings**

* Reduces time spent on **manual vulnerability triage** by focusing on exploitable risks.
* Minimizes the risk of **costly breaches, downtime, and reputational damage**.
* Ensures security is **built-in from the start**, reducing remediation costs later in the SDLC.

**Supporting Cloud-Native and Hybrid Environments**

* Scans **Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-based applications** for security vulnerabilities.
* Ensures **secure software delivery across multi-cloud and hybrid environments**.
* Detects risks in **infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations**.

## **Purpose of JFrog Advanced Security**

✔ **Secure the Software Supply Chain** – Prevent malicious code injection, dependency attacks, and misconfigurations.

✔ **Detect and Remediate Vulnerabilities** – Identify security flaws in open-source dependencies, containers, and infrastructure.

✔ **Eliminate False Positives with Contextual Analysis** – Prioritize real security threats by assessing exploitability within the artifact’s context.

✔ **Prevent Secrets Exposure** – Detect leaked API keys, credentials, and sensitive data to avoid security breaches.

✔ **Ensure Compliance with Industry Standards** – Automate security policies to meet **ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, GDPR, and other regulations**.

✔ **Integrate Security into DevOps (DevSecOps)** – Embed security checks directly into CI/CD pipelines for **continuous security scanning**.

✔ **Enable Automated Security Policies** – Define security rules to enforce best practices and prevent high-risk deployments.

✔ **Reduce Operational Costs and Risk** – Minimize time spent on security triage, prevent costly breaches, and streamline remediation.

✔ **Support Cloud-Native Security** – Scan **Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud environments** for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

✔ **Enhance Software Quality and Reliability** – Ensure only **secure and compliant** artifacts move to production.
