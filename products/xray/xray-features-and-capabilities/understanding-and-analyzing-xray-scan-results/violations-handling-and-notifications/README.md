# Violations Handling and Notifications

Xray provides robust mechanisms for **violation handling** and **notifications** to ensure teams are alerted to issues promptly and efficiently. By leveraging **Jira integration, webhooks, and emails**, Xray ensures that stakeholders are informed and can take corrective actions when violations occur.

### **1. Jira Integration for Violations Handling**

Xray integrates seamlessly with Jira, allowing violations (such as security issues, or non-compliance) to be automatically linked to Jira issues. This integration ensures:

* **Automated Issue Creation:** When a violation occurs during a test execution, Xray can automatically create a Jira issue (Bug, Task, or other custom issue types) to track and manage the problem.
* **Issue Updates & Workflows:** Violations linked to Jira issues follow Jiraâ€™s customizable workflows, enabling teams to manage resolution steps, assign responsibilities, and track progress.
* **Traceability & Reporting:** Teams can use Jira dashboards and filters to track unresolved violations and measure compliance over time.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If a test case fails due to a critical defect, Xray can automatically generate a Jira bug with relevant test execution details, logs, and screenshots.

### **2. Webhooks for Real-Time Notifications**

Webhooks in Xray provide a **real-time mechanism** for external systems or services to react to violations dynamically. By configuring webhooks, teams can:

* **Trigger Custom Actions:** Notify CI/CD pipelines, external monitoring tools, or security platforms when a violation occurs.
* **Integrate with Slack/MS Teams:** Send instant alerts to development teams via chat applications.
* **Enable Automation & Third-Party Integrations:** Connect with ITSM tools, incident response systems, or logging platforms.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** A webhook can be set up to notify a **security monitoring system** whenever a test identifies a security vulnerability, triggering an immediate investigation.

### **3. Email Notifications for Stakeholder Awareness**

Emails provide a direct method of notifying relevant stakeholders about test violations, ensuring visibility across teams. Xray supports:

* **Automated Email Alerts:** Configurable notifications sent when violations occur.
* **Customizable Recipients:** Notify specific users, groups, or external contacts based on severity.
* **Scheduled Reports:** Periodic emails summarizing unresolved violations.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** A **QA Manager** can receive a daily email report listing all failed critical tests, allowing them to take action before the next deployment.
