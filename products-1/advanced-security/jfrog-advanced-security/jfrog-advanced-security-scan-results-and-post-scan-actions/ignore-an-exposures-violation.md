Ignore rules allow you to whitelist and ignore security violation rules, in order to filter out unwanted violation noise. For example, you might be running Advanced Scans on a testing repository and donâ€™t want these violations to hinder your testing, or you might have instilled strict actions if a violation is found that is a blocker for continuing your development. You want to ignore the specific violation for the time being.

There are many reasons why you might want to ignore a violation, you can read more about it here [Ignore Rules](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Ignore+Rules).

Managing, deleting and other Ignore Rules related actions are described in [Ignore Rules](https://about/document/preview/514594#UUID-dcb8d4a3-bb33-8f0f-7c8b-bc917b82cb9d).
