# Features and Capabilities

JFrog Frogbot serves as an indispensable tool for enhancing security and compliance throughout the software development process in SCMs. Several key attributes underscore its value:

**Comprehensive Security Scanning**\
Frogbot diligently assesses source code for a myriad of vulnerabilities. It addresses not only code vulnerabilities through SAST but also known issues in dependencies via SCA, as well as potential misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Additionally, its CVE Contextual Analysis capability significantly reduces false positives while protecting against secrets exposure.

**Data Privacy**\
One of Frogbot's critical advantages is its commitment to data privacy. The bot operates directly on your CI machine, ensuring that source code remains on-premises. Only essential metadata—such as filenames and line numbers—are sent to the JFrog platform, maintaining a high standard of data security.

**Proactive Vulnerability Management**\
By continuously monitoring code and scanning pull requests, Frogbot empowers developers by alerting them to emerging vulnerabilities before merging. This proactive approach helps maintain a secure codebase.

**Streamlined Remediation**\
Frogbot’s ability to automatically generate pull requests with fixes for SCA vulnerabilities simplifies the remediation process, making it easier for development teams to address security issues swiftly.

**Enhanced Collaboration**\
Frogbot enhances collaboration by adding insightful comments on pull requests, keeping the entire team informed and engaged in security practices.

**Compliance and Risk Mitigation**\
As teams strive to meet compliance standards and reduce risks, Frogbot integrates seamlessly into the development lifecycle, reinforcing security at every stage.

**Complementary Tool**\
While Frogbot offers robust scanning capabilities, proactive security measures remain essential. Developers are encouraged to conduct additional scans within their IDEs prior to committing changes, further strengthening overall security.
