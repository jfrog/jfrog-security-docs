# How to Create a Waiver Request from the Audit Page

### **Use Case**

Developers reviewing blocked package events in the Audit page can create waiver requests directly from the event pane. This allows a faster, pre-filled workflow without repeating the package selection step.

### **Overview of the Audit Page (Developer Perspective)**

Developers use the Audit page to:

* View all blocked download events
* Understand why the package was blocked
* Review policy violations
* Take action by requesting a waiver

The right-hand side pane now includes a **Create New Waiver Request** button for all eligible blocked events.

### **Workflow Steps**

#### **Step 1: Open a Blocked Event in Audit**

1. Go to **Applications → Curation → Audit**.
2. Select a blocked event.
3. The details pane opens on the right.

#### **Step 2: Launch a Waiver Request**

1. Click **Create New Waiver Request**.
2. You are automatically taken to **Step 2** of the waiver workflow.
   * Package name
   * Version
   * Requester
   * Origin repository

…all come pre-selected.

This skips the selection step.

#### **Step 4: Review Event Details**

The interface displays policy violations and event metadata.

If any blocking policy is **Not Allowed**, the waiver cannot be submitted.

#### **Step 4: Enter Justification and Submit**

1. Enter your request reason (max 300 chars).
2. Click **Submit** when enabled.
3. You will be redirected to **Waivers Requests** to track your submission.
