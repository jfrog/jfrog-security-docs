# How to Request a License Review in JFrog Catalog

**Use case**: When attempting to download a package with an unknown or missing license, the process may be blocked, causing delays in your workflow. To resolve this, you can submit a **License Review Request** to the JFrog research team. The review process ensures the correct license is identified, improving data accuracy and preventing future disruptions.

**Steps:**

1. On the package details page, click **Request a License Review** button in the top-right corner.
2.  In the **Request a License Review** form:

    * Select whether the review applies to the **Current Version** or **All Versions**.
    * _(Optional)_ Enter a **Suggested License** (for example: MIT, Apache-2.0).
    * _(Optional)_ Provide a **Source URL** to help the JFrog research team verify your information.
    * _(Optional)_ Add a **Contact Email** to receive status notifications.

    > üí° **Tip:** The email you provide will be used to notify you when the review is complete.
3.  Click **Submit** to send the request.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Once submitted, you cannot cancel or edit the request, and you cannot resubmit the same request for the same package version.
4. After submission, you will receive an **email confirmation** that your request has been logged.
5. When the JFrog team completes the manual review, you will receive another email with the results and a link to view them in the UI.

### Results

* The JFrog research team reviews the package license.
