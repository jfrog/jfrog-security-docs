# Quick Start

## **Modes of Operation**

The JFrog Plugin offers two modes: **Local** and **CI**. You can switch between them using the JFrog Panel tabs at the IDE's bottom.

### **Local View**

* Displays information about the local code as it is being developed in the IDE.
* Enables continuous scanning of your project with the JFrog Platform.
* Identifies security vulnerabilities in dependencies and source code before they become part of the final product.
* To scan your project, click the **Run Scan** button in the JFrog panel.

### **CI View**

* Tracks code as it is built, tested, and scanned by a CI server.
* Displays build status and includes a link to the CI server log.
* Provides security information about build artifacts and dependencies.
* Accessible through the **JFrog Panel > CI Tab**.

## Severity Icons

The plugin uses severity icons to indicate the highest severity issue within a selected component and its transitive dependencies.

## **How Does it Work?**

* The CI information displayed in the IDE is fetched from **JFrog Artifactory**.
* Build details are stored as **build-info**, published to Artifactory by the CI server.
* If **JFrog Xray** scans build-info, the plugin will display the scan results in the **CI View**.

## **Setting Up CI Integration**

Before the **CI View** can display data, configure your CI pipeline to expose build information:

1. Go to **Settings (Preferences) > Other Settings > JFrog Global Configuration**.
2. Configure your **JFrog Platform URL** and user credentials.
3. Navigate to **Settings (Preferences) > Other Settings > JFrog CI Integration**.
4. Set your CI **Build Name Pattern** â€“ this should match the build name published to Artifactory.
   * Use `*` to view all builds published to Artifactory.
5. Click **Apply**, then open the **CI Tab** in the JFrog panel.
6. Click **Refresh** to fetch and display build details.
