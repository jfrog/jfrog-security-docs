# Integrating Security in CI/CD Pipelines

## **Pre-Deployment Validation**

1. Ensure all artifacts in Artifactory pass Xray scans before deployment.
2. Set up policies in JFrog Advanced Security to block artifacts with critical CVEs.

## **Deploy Securely**

1. Use the Runtime Controller to monitor Kubernetes clusters and ensure only trusted images are deployed.
2. Validate that runtime sensors are operational on all cluster nodes.

## **Monitor Runtime Behavior**

1. Continuously monitor runtime processes for anomalies (e.g., unexpected binaries or integrity violations).
2. Use the Process Table to examine detailed runtime behavior and identify high-risk processes.

## **Automate Remediation**

1. Configure automated alerts for critical issues (e.g., via Slack or email integrations).
2. Trigger pipeline workflows to replace compromised images with patched versions.
