# Index Xray Resources

### **What Does "Indexing Resources" Mean in Xray?**

In JFrog Xray, **indexing resources** refers to the process of **analyzing, mapping, and storing metadata** about software components to enable **deep security scanning and compliance monitoring**.

Indexing is **a prerequisite for scanning**â€”Xray **does not automatically scan all repositories, builds, or artifacts** unless they are explicitly **indexed**. By indexing a resource, Xray can **track dependencies, vulnerabilities, licenses, and operational risks** effectively.

***

### **Why is Indexing Important?**

âœ” **Enables vulnerability and compliance scanning** â€“ Xray can only scan components that are **indexed**.\
âœ” **Provides dependency visibility** â€“ Helps track **direct and transitive dependencies** in repositories and builds.\
âœ” **Improves scan performance** â€“ Indexed resources are analyzed **more efficiently**, reducing scan times.\
âœ” **Allows impact analysis** â€“ Identifies which artifacts are affected by **newly discovered vulnerabilities**.

ðŸš€ **Example:** If a new CVE is discovered, Xray **automatically identifies all indexed artifacts** that contain the vulnerable package.

### **Types of Indexable Resources in Xray**

Xray supports indexing at **three levels**:

| **Resource Type**   | **Description**                                                 | **Best Use Case**                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repositories**    | Indexes artifacts stored in **JFrog Artifactory repositories**. | Continuous monitoring of **stored software components**.                     |
| **Builds**          | Indexes **CI/CD-generated builds**, including all dependencies. | Ensures that **build artifacts are free of vulnerabilities** before release. |
| **Release Bundles** | Indexes software **packaged for distribution**.                 | Ensures **final software releases are secure and compliant**.                |

### **How Indexing Works in Xray**

#### **1. Indexing Repositories/Builds/ Release Bundles**

* Xray does **not automatically index all resources**â€”you must **enable indexing** for a specific resource.
* Indexed repositories allow Xray to scan artifacts **as they are uploaded or modified**.
