# Vulnerability Contextual Analysis

JFrog Security and the JFrog research team continuously strive to enhance security. As part of this effort, we are introducing **Vulnerability Contextual Analysis**, an extension of JFrog Xray’s **CVE Research and Enrichment** feature. This new capability helps prioritize vulnerabilities, allowing you to focus on the most critical issues while efficiently allocating resources for remediation.

## Prerequisites

* **JFrog Xray Installed & Configured** – Ensure Xray is properly set up to scan repositories and artifacts.
* **Supported Xray Version** – Some features require Xray **3.77.4 or later**.
* **Access to Repositories** – Permissions to scan Docker, Maven, or Gradle repositories.
* **Containerized Environment** – Certain analysis features apply specifically to containers.
* **Basic CVE Knowledge** – Understanding of vulnerability scanning and CVE impact.

## The Challenge

When JFrog Xray scans your packages, it can detect thousands of vulnerabilities. Developers must then sift through extensive lists to determine which vulnerabilities are relevant, a process that can be both time-consuming and error-prone. In many cases, vulnerabilities may not even impact your artifacts, making it difficult to know where to start.

## The Solution

**Vulnerability Contextual Analysis** leverages artifact context to eliminate false positives, ensuring that only relevant vulnerabilities are flagged. This is achieved through automated scanners that analyze containerized environments, identifying reachable paths for detected vulnerabilities.

Xray automatically validates high and very high-impact vulnerabilities, including those requiring specific conditions for exploitation. It then provides **contextual analysis information**, helping you determine which vulnerabilities are applicable to a specific artifact.

## Key Benefits

* **Real-world risk assessment:** Analyzes finished code from an attacker's perspective, identifying which issues are truly exploitable and their potential impact.
* **Context-aware testing:** Assesses vulnerabilities in the context of the complete artifact, build, or Release Bundle.
* **Actionable remediation:** Enables targeted mitigation based on the actual artifact, build, or Release Bundle.
