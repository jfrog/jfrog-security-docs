# Detecting Active Artifacts in Runtime

This document provides instructions on how to identify artifacts in Artifactory that are currently running in runtime. By following the steps outlined below, users can detect active artifacts, assess their security status, and take necessary actions to mitigate potential risks.

1. **Navigate to the Artifactory Artifacts Tree:**
   * Open the JFrog Platform and go to the **Artifactory** section.
   * Browse through the repository tree to locate the desired artifact.
2. **Identify Runtime-Detected Artifacts:**
   * If an artifact from the selected repository is actively running in runtime, a **detection button** will appear in the upper right corner of the page.
   * The button will also indicate whether any detected artifacts have vulnerabilities.
3. **Access Additional Details:**
   * Click the **detection button** to view more information about the artifact.
   * You will be redirected to the **Runtime Live Assessment** page.
4. **Review Runtime Live Assessment:**
   * Examine details such as the artifact's location, where it is currently running, and any associated security risks.
   * Use this information to take appropriate actions to address vulnerabilities or security concerns.
