# Watches in JFrog Xray

Security and compliance in modern software development require continuous monitoring of dependencies, builds, and repositories. JFrog Xray uses Watches as a powerful mechanism to track, analyze, and enforce policies on software artifacts throughout the development lifecycle.

By configuring Watches, organizations can proactively detect security, compliance, and operational risk violations, across their entire software supply chain.

### **What Are Watches in Xray?**

A Watch in JFrog Xray is a customizable security and compliance monitoring entity that allows teams to track specific repositories, builds, and release bundles.

Watches enable:

* **Targeted Monitoring** – Focus on specific artifacts, repositories, builds, release bundles, or projects.
* **Automated Security & Compliance** – Apply predefined policies to trigger violations.
* **Proactive Threat Detection** – Identify security, compliance, and operational risk violations before they become a risk.

Watches allow users to define what to monitor and how to respond.

### **How Watches Work in Xray**

#### **1. Define a Watch Scope**

Watches let you specify which components to monitor by selecting:

* **Repositories**&#x20;
* **Builds**&#x20;
* **Release Bundles**&#x20;
* **Projects**&#x20;

This enables teams to apply different policies to different stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

#### **2. Apply Policies to the Watch**

Watches enforce **policies** based on organizational security and compliance needs.

**Policy Types Applied to Watches**

* **Security Policies** – Detect security issues in open-source components.
* **Compliance Policies** – Ensure software components comply with license requirements.
* **Operational Risk Policies** – Identify outdated, deprecated, or unmaintained software components.

#### 3. Apply Watches on Existing Content

Once a Watch is created, it will scan artifacts in the specified resources when a scan-triggering event happens, and issue Violations accordingly. However, until a scan-triggering event happens, artifacts already existing in the system will not be scanned by the Watch. So, to make sure a Watch is immediately applied to the relevant artifacts, you can invoke it manually by hovering over it and selecting Apply on Existing Content.

Clicking the button pops up a dialog that lets you specify which of the resources assigned to the watch should be scanned, and a date range that defines when the artifact was last scanned by Xray.

**Note**: **Not available for All Repositories or All Builds**

You can only manually invoke a Watch on existing content if the Watch is defined on specific resources and not on All Repositories or All Builds.&#x20;

#### 4. Examine Violations on a Watch

You can review and manage all the violations generated by a Watch under a central location **Application > Xray > Watch Violations** on an ongoing basis.&#x20;

You can view the list of the violations, search for violations according to filters, and set [ignore rules](ignore-rules.md).
