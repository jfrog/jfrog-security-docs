# How to Send Email Notifications for Each Critical Vulnerability Found in Resource

This use case describes how to configure **Xray Policies and Watches** to trigger an **email notification** for a resource that contains a **Critical** vulnerability.

#### **Step 1: Define a Security Policy for Critical Vulnerabilities**

ðŸ“Œ**Goal:** Create a policy to trigger email notifications for each Critical vulnerability found in a resource.

1. Navigate to **Application > Xray** > **Watches & Policies**.
2. Click **New Policy**, enter a name, and select **Security** as the type.
3. Configure the rule:
   1. Enter a rule name.&#x20;
   2. Select the CVEs rule type.&#x20;

   4. Select the Notify Email action and enter a valid email address.&#x20;
4. Apply on Scope. Attach the Policy to a Watch.
5. Save the policy.

#### **Step 2: Test Email Notification (Build with Critical Vulnerability)**

**Goal:** Ensure that email notifications are sent when a build contains a Critical vulnerability.

**Scenario : Vulnerable Build in CI/CD ( Notified)**

A Jenkins pipeline attempts to build an application using a vulnerable package

**Expected Result:**

* A violation is created for the build due to the **Critical** vulnerability.
* The email recipient **receives an email notification**.

#### **Step 3: Review & Address the Violation**
