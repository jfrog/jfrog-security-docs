# Overview

JFrog Xray is a **universal software composition analysis (SCA) and security solution** that provides **deep security, compliance, and operational risk insights** across the **entire software development lifecycle (SDLC)**. Integrated seamlessly with **JFrog Artifactory**, Xray enables organizations to **proactively detect vulnerabilities, enforce compliance policies, and manage software supply chain risks** before applications reach production.

Xray is a **core component of JFrog Security**, playing a **critical role in DevSecOps** by helping developers, security teams, and compliance officers identify and mitigate security issues **as early as possible in the SDLC**.

### **Where Xray Fits in the JFrog Security Timeline**

Security in the software development process must be **continuous**, spanning from **code development to deployment and beyond**. JFrog Xray integrates into multiple stages of the software lifecycle, ensuring that security is **proactive rather than reactive**.

#### **JFrog Security Timeline: Key Stages & Xrayâ€™s Role**

| Stage                                            | Xray's Role                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Development (Shift Left)**                | âœ… **Scans dependencies in IDEs & CLI** before committing code.                                     |
| **Artifact Management (Repository Security)**    | âœ… **Continuously scans Artifactory repositories** for security, compliance, and operational risks. |
| **Build & Package (CI/CD Security)**             | âœ… **Scans builds in CI/CD pipelines** to detect vulnerabilities.                                   |
| **Release Validation (Pre-Deployment Security)** | âœ… **Scans release bundles** before promotion or distribution to ensure compliance and security.    |
| **Production & Runtime Security**                | âœ… **Monitors for newly discovered vulnerabilities** in already deployed artifacts.                 |

### **Business Needs for JFrog Xray**

Organizations face increasing challenges in securing their software supply chain. Key concerns include:

#### **ðŸ”¹ Preventing Supply Chain Attacks**

* Attackers exploit **open-source registries** to distribute **malicious packages**.
* Xray detects and blocks **compromised components** before they enter the development pipeline.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Managing Open-Source Risks**

* Dependencies introduce **security vulnerabilities, license restrictions, and operational risks**.
* Organizations require **automated scanning and policy enforcement** to control third-party software usage.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Ensuring Regulatory Compliance & Governance**

* Security regulations (e.g., **NIST, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2**) demand strict control over software dependencies.
* Xray ensures **only compliant and secure components** enter production environments.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Reducing Security Overhead**

* Security teams struggle with **manual dependency reviews** and **reactive fixes**.
* Xray automates security checks, **freeing teams to focus on high-priority threats**.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Improving Development Efficiency**

* Developers unknowingly introduce **vulnerable or non-compliant dependencies**.
* Xray **proactively prevents risky components** from entering projects, reducing costly rework.
