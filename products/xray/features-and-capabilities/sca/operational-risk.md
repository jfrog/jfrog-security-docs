# Operational Risk

Beyond security vulnerabilities and compliance issues, **operational risks** in software components can impact system reliability, maintainability, and overall software quality. These risks arise from **outdated, deprecated, or unmaintained dependencies** that may no longer receive updates, security patches, or community support.

JFrog Xray provides **Operational Risk Analysis**, enabling organizations to detect and mitigate risks **before they affect production environments**. By identifying software components with **end-of-life (EOL) statuses, deprecated libraries, and maintenance concerns**, teams can make informed decisions to maintain **software stability and long-term viability**.

***

### **What is Operational Risk in Software?**

Operational risk refers to **non-security-related issues** that can affect a software componentâ€™s **performance, reliability, or maintainability**.

Common operational risks include:\
âœ” **End-of-Life (EOL) Software** â€“ Components that **no longer receive updates or security patches**.\
âœ” **Deprecated Dependencies** â€“ Libraries marked **as obsolete or replaced** by newer versions.\
âœ” **Unmaintained Open-Source Projects** â€“ Software that **hasnâ€™t been updated for a long period**, increasing the risk of compatibility issues.\
âœ” **High-Impact Component Updates** â€“ Major version changes that introduce **breaking changes or API modifications**.\
âœ” **Abandoned Projects** â€“ Open-source components with **no active contributors or maintainers**.

ðŸš€ **Example:** A legacy **Node.js package** used in a production system is flagged as **deprecated**, meaning future updates may introduce **breaking changes or vulnerabilities**.

### **How Xray Detects Operational Risks**

Xray continuously monitors software components in **repositories, builds, and release bundles**, identifying key operational risks based on:

âœ” **Version Stability** â€“ Detects if a component **hasnâ€™t been updated for an extended period**.\
âœ” **End-of-Life Status** â€“ Flags software that has reached **EOL and no longer receives support**.\
âœ” **Community and Maintenance Health** â€“ Analyzes **activity levels** of open-source maintainers.\
âœ” **API and Compatibility Changes** â€“ Identifies **major version changes** that may introduce **breaking updates**.\
âœ” **License Status Changes** â€“ Notifies teams when **license modifications impact compliance**.

ðŸš€ **Example:** A **Maven library** flagged as **end-of-life** is still being used in a critical build pipeline. Xray warns developers that the package **is no longer maintained** and recommends an **alternative**.

### **Mitigating Operational Risks with Xray**

#### **1. Monitor Dependencies Continuously**

* Apply **Operational Risk Policies** to repositories and builds.
* Detect **outdated and deprecated** dependencies **before they impact production**.

#### **2. Enforce Governance in CI/CD Pipelines**

* Configure Xray to **fail builds** if they contain **high-risk operational components**.
* Require **dependency reviews** before promoting artifacts.

#### **3. Plan for End-of-Life Transitions**

* Track **EOL software** and migrate to **actively maintained alternatives**.
* Avoid dependencies that **lack long-term maintenance support**.

#### **4. Establish a Risk Management Strategy**

* Regularly **audit software dependencies** for **compatibility and lifecycle health**.
* Work with **open-source communities** to assess long-term viability.
