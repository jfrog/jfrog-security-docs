# Create Policies

This is a Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Policy in Xray. To learn more about Policies, click [here](../features-and-capabilities/sdlc-policy-mangement/).

1. Navigate to **Xray → Watches & Policies**.
2. Click **New Policy**.
3. Enter a **Policy Name** (e.g., "Production Security Policy").
4. (Optional) Add a **Description** explaining the policy’s purpose.
5. Choose the **Policy Type**:
   * **Security Policy** – Detects vulnerabilities in artifacts.
   * **License Compliance Policy** – Enforces open-source license rules.
   * **Operational Risk Policy** – Flags outdated, deprecated, or unmaintained dependencies.&#x20;
6. Click **Add Rule** to create a new rule. Each policy consists of rules that define the conditions and enforcement actions.
7. Apply on Scope attaches the Policy to a Watch. Policies are **enforced through Watches**, which monitor repositories, builds, and release bundles.
8. Select an existing Watch.
9. Click **Save & Apply**.

### **Security Policy Rules**

If you selected **Security Policy**, configure one of the Rule Types

1. **CVEs**
   1. **Define the Rule Category**:
      * By Minimal Severity:
        * Critical (Highest risk)
        * High
        * Medium
        * Low (Least severe)
        * All Severities
      * **By the CVSS Score Range** (0-10)
      * **By specific CVE IDs**
   2. Enable **Except if a Fix Version is not available** to filter vulnerabilities without a fix version.
   3. Enable **Skip not applicable CVEs** to filter vulnerabilities that do not impact your environment. (JFrog Advanced Security required)
2. **SAST**
   1. Detects SAST issues in 1st party source code
3. **Malicious Packages**
   1. Detects 3rd party packages that the JFrog Security Research team has identified as malicious.
4. **Exposures**
   1. &#x20;Select one or more exposure categories and set a Minimal Severity
5. **Package Version**
   1. Select the package type
   2. Type the package name
   3. Select the package versions&#x20;

#### **Example Security Rules:**

* #### Block downloads of artifacts with Critical CVEs.
* #### Fail builds if vulnerabilities have a CVSS score of 9 or higher.
* #### Send email notifications for newly discovered High and Critical vulnerabilities.

### **License Compliance Policy Rules**

If you selected **License Compliance Policy**, configure the License Rule Type:

* **Banned Licenses** – Prevents the use of specific licenses (e.g., GPL-3.0).
* **Allowed Licenses** – Ensures artifacts only use approved licenses.

#### **Example License Compliance Rule:**

* #### Notify the use of GPL-3.0 and AGPL in production.
* #### Allow only MIT, Apache 2.0, and BSD licenses.
* #### Fail builds if a banned license is detected.

### **Operational Risk Policy Rules**&#x20;

If you selected **Operational Risk Policy**, configure the Rule Category:

1. **Minimal Severity**
   1. High (Highest risk)
   2. Medium
   3. Low (Least severe)
2. **Custom Condition**
   * **End-of-Life Software** – Flags packages that are no longer maintained.
   * **Deprecated Components** – Detects libraries marked as obsolete.
   * **Unmaintained Open-Source Projects** – Flags packages with no updates in over 12 months.
   * **High-Impact Updates** – Identifies major version changes with breaking updates.

#### **Example Operational Risk Rule:**

* #### Alert developers if a dependency has not been updated in 12+ months.
* #### Fail builds if a package is flagged as end-of-life.
* #### Block downloads of deprecated components.

### Set Enforcement Actions

Violation will be generated by default for each policy violation

* **Trigger Webhook** after the policy is violated
* **Create a Jira ticke**t for each policy violation
* **Notify the Watch recipient** via email
* **Notify the Developer** of the resource via email
* **Notify email** for the configured email address list
* **Fail builds** if vulnerabilities are detected. You can add a grace period before a build fails, giving teams time to address policy violations without immediate disruption.\`
* **Block downloads** of artifacts. Starting from Xray 3.118.3 and above, you can add a grace period before an artifact is blocked from downloading, giving teams time to address policy violations without immediate disruption.
* **Block Release Bundle** Promotion and distribution actions in the Release Lifecycle.

### **Best Practices for Policy Configuration in Xray**

* **Use Separate Policies for Different Environments** – Apply stricter policies in production than in development.
* **Customize Severity Thresholds** – Focus on critical risks first to avoid false positives.
* **Enable Exposures and Contextual Analysis** – Prioritize vulnerabilities that pose real-world threats.
* **Regularly Review and Update Policies** – Keep policies aligned with new security threats and compliance requirements.
