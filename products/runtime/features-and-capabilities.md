# Features and Capabilities

## Traceability

* **Detect and analyze active artifacts** in runtime, tracing them back to their source in JFrog Artifactory.

## Prioritization

JFrog Runtime provides **real-time security insights** by continuously monitoring active components within Kubernetes environments. **Live Assessment** allows security and DevOps teams to:

* **Detect and analyze active artifacts** in runtime, tracing them back to their source in JFrog Artifactory.
* **Identify security risks** such as malicious packages, untrusted images, integrity violations, and critical CVEs.
* **Monitor workloads and processes**, offering deep visibility into running applications and their security posture.
* **Risk analysis across the infrastructure**, allowing teams to track vulnerabilities and security exposures.
* **Contextual security insights** by integrating with JFrog Xray and Advanced Security for enriched vulnerability detection.

## Visibility

JFrog Runtime enhances visibility by **correlating runtime artifacts with their sources** and providing detailed security insights, including:

* **Comprehensive runtime tracing** of images, workloads, and processes.
* **Cluster-wide observability**, providing a clear picture of security risks across multiple Kubernetes nodes and cloud providers.
* **Runtime behavior monitoring**, using eBPF technology to track file access, process execution, and kernel activity.

## Integrity

Ensuring software integrity is crucial to maintaining a secure environment. JFrog Runtime strengthens integrity by:

* **Detecting integrity violations**, identifying discrepancies between images stored in Artifactory and binaries running in the cluster.
* **Flagging unauthorized or untrusted images**, preventing the execution of code from unverified sources.

## Real-Time Alerting

* **Providing automated security policy enforcement**, allowing organizations to apply predefined security rules that ensure compliance.
