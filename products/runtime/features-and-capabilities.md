# Features and Capabilities

## **Visibility**

* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides live status updates on images detected in monitored clusters.
* **Enhanced Visibility (Runtime Impact only)**: Offers deeper insights into running processes within clusters.

## **Trust Assessment**

* Confirm whether an image originates from a trusted registry.
* Identifies potential integrity violations in images.

## **Prioritization**

* **Cross-Correlation Insights**: Integrates with JFrog Xray and Advanced Security to assess the severity and relevance of detected images and potentially malicious packages.
* **Blast Radius Analysis**: Evaluates the number of workloads using specific images and their locations across clusters, helping to gauge the impact of vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Prioritization (Runtime Impact only)**:
  * Determines if vulnerable code is actively loaded into memory, focusing on real threats.
  * Helps prioritize remediation efforts by identifying vulnerabilities currently in use.

## **Traceability**

* Enhances traceability by identifying image owners and enabling rapid risk mitigation by locating the build owner and deployer.

## **Real-Time Alerting**

* Automates security policy enforcement, allowing organizations to apply predefined security rules for compliance.
