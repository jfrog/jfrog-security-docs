# Runtime Impact

### Version 1.3

#### Workload Automation Service

Create event-driven [Workers to automate responses to workload](../configure-runtime/workload-automation-service.md) changes.\
Workers provide a serverless execution environment, triggered by real-time platform events like image updates and security insights.

#### Mapping Vulnerable Images to Clusters and Workloads

Quickly [identify where risks exist in your environment by mapping vulnerable images](../how-tos/inspecting-live-software-components.md#identifying-risk-locations-in-runtime-by-mapping-vulnerable-images-to-clusters-and-workloads) to affected clusters and workloads.\
Use the Live Assessment view to identify and remediate image-based vulnerabilities across workloads and clusters more efficiently.

### Version 1.4

#### AWS Fargate Support&#x20;

JFrog Runtime now supports [AWS Fargate](../supported-technologies/), enabling serverless container execution without managing infrastructure.
