# Scanning GitHub Repositories

JFrog Frogbot is a powerful Git bot designed to scan your Git repositories for security vulnerabilities, enhancing your software's security at the development stage. Frogbot operates by scanning pull requests as soon as they are opened, but before they are merged. This proactive approach helps identify and notify developers of potential vulnerabilities, preventing security issues from being introduced into the codebase.

In addition to scanning pull requests in real-time, Frogbot periodically scans your Git repository and automatically creates pull requests with fixes for detected vulnerabilities, making vulnerability management easier and more efficient.
