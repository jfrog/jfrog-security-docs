## Create a Security Policy with Advanced Scan Rules

Policies allow you to define security rules with corresponding automatic actions. Policies are enforced by applying them to **Xray Watches**. For more details on creating policies, see **Creating Xray Policies and Rules**.

We recommend creating policies to generate a **focused list of violations** based on your security criteria.

**Creating an Exposures Policy**

1. Navigate to **Administration Module** > **Xray** > **Watches & Policies**.
2. In the **Policies** tab, click **New Policy**.
3. Select the **policy rule type** as **Security**.
4. Click **New Rule**, then select **Exposures** from the **Type** drop-down menu.
5. Set the **Minimal JFrog Severity**, which is determined by the **JFrog Security Research Team** after a manual CVE analysis. A violation is issued only if the selected severity is met.
6. Select one or more **Exposure Categories** to specify when a violation should be issued.
7. Define **Automatic Actions** to determine the systemâ€™s response to policy violations. For further details, refer to **Creating Xray Policies and Rules**.

**Creating a Contextual Analysis Policy**

1. Navigate to **Administration Module** > **Xray** > **Watches & Policies**.
2. In the **Policies** tab, click **New Policy**.
3. Select the **policy rule type** as **Security**.
4. Check the **Skip Not Applicable CVEs** option. This ensures that the policy does not issue violations for CVEs found **not applicable** by the **Contextual Analysis Scanners**.
