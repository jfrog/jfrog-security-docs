# Catalog

JFrog Catalog is a centralized repository of open-source software (OSS) packages and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), enriched with security, compliance, and operational risk insights. It serves as a **single source of truth** for organizations managing their software supply chain, offering deep visibility into package vulnerabilities, dependencies, and licensing requirements.

With data continuously enriched by **JFrog Security Research**, JFrog Catalog provides actionable intelligence that helps development, security, and compliance teams make informed decisions about the software components they use.

#### **Where Does JFrog Catalog Fit in the Security Timeline?**

JFrog Catalog acts as the **foundation** for JFrog's security products, **providing enriched OSS metadata, vulnerabilities, dependencies, and license insights** before software is ingested into a development pipeline. It is primarily used **before** security scanning and enforcement mechanisms take place.

**JFrog Catalog (ðŸ“‹ Pre-Selection & OSS Intelligence)**

* When? **Before software components are introduced into development.**
