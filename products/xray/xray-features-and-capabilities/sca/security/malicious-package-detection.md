# Malicious Package Detection

The rise of supply chain attacks has made malicious software packages a significant security risk. Attackers inject harmful code into open-source packages, container images, and third-party dependencies, which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise.

JFrog Xray provides advanced malicious package detection, identifying and blocking compromised packages before they enter your development pipeline.

### **What Are Malicious Packages?**

Malicious packages are **intentionally crafted** software components that:

* Contains backdoors, trojans, or hidden exploits.
* Exfiltrate sensitive data or inject harmful code into applications.
* Masquerade as legitimate open-source libraries to trick developers.
* Are typosquatted (named similarly to popular libraries to deceive users).

**Example:** A package named `requests-plus` mimics the popular `requests` Python library but contains hidden data-stealing malware.

### **How JFrog Xray Detects Malicious Packages**

JFrog Xray continuously monitors **open-source registries and repositories**, using **threat intelligence and behavioral analysis** to detect:

✔ **Backdoored and trojanized packages** – Identifies software components with **malicious payloads**.\
✔ **Typosquatting attacks** – Flags packages that **mimic trusted libraries**.\
✔ **Dependency confusion attacks** – Detects **unauthorized versions** of internal libraries.\
✔ **Obfuscated or hidden malicious code** – Analyzes **package metadata, scripts, and execution behavior**.\
✔ **Recently compromised libraries** – Alerts teams when a previously safe package becomes **malicious**.

### **JFrog Security Research & Threat Intelligence**

JFrog’s **Security Research Team** actively analyzes and reports **newly discovered malicious packages**, integrating real-time intelligence into Xray.

**Example:** JFrog Security Research uncovered over **200 malicious npm packages**, leading to their **removal from the registry**.

### **How to Protect Your Software Supply Chain**

#### **1. Enable Malicious Package Scanning in Xray**

* Apply **security policies** to repositories and builds.
* Automatically **block the download of known malicious packages**.

#### **2. Monitor and Audit Dependencies**

* Regularly scan **third-party dependencies** for **new security threats**.
* Use **JFrog Xray’s recursive scanning** to analyze nested components.

#### **3. Implement CI/CD Security Controls**

* Configure **Xray Watches** to **fail builds containing malicious dependencies**.
* Enforce **strict package validation policies** in development pipelines.

#### **4. Keep Security Policies Updated**

* Ensure **continuous monitoring** for **new threats**.
* Regularly review **security alerts and threat intelligence reports**.
