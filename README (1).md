### Why JFrog Security?

* **End-to-End Protection:** Security is embedded throughout the SDLC, from OSS Firewall, source code analysis, and binary analysis to runtime monitoring.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works natively with CI/CD pipelines, package registries, and DevOps tools.
* **Automated Security & Compliance:** Continuous scanning, risk assessment, and policy enforcement.

### Key Capabilities

* **JFrog Xray (SCA):** Source code and Binary analysis to detect open-source package risks (vulnerabilities, Licenses, Operational risks, and Malicious packages), with an extensive Policy engine and Reporting capabilities.
* **JFrog Advanced Security (SAST, Secrets, CVEs analysis, and IaC Security):** Source code and Binary advanced scans that go beyond SCA to expose 1st party code issues, and misconfiguration while reducing noise using CVEs contextual analysis.
* **JFrog Curation:** Prevent risky dependencies by blocking them before they enter your Artifactory.
* **JFrog Runtime Security:** Monitors running Kubernetes clusters for threats and integrity check.
