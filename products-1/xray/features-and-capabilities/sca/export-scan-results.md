# Export Scan Results

JFrog Xray allows you to **export artifact scan results** for various **security, compliance, and operational** use cases. This enables organizations to **analyze vulnerabilities, enforce policies, and generate detailed reports** for auditing and compliance.

#### **Use Cases for Exporting Scan Results**

You can export scan results for multiple scenarios, including:

* **Security Analysis** – Identify vulnerabilities and security risks.
* **Secret Detection** _(Available in JFrog Advanced Security)_ – Detect sensitive data leaks.
* **Application Misconfigurations** _(Available in JFrog Advanced Security)_ – Identify security weaknesses.
* **Legal Compliance** – Review and manage open-source licenses.
* **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** – Gain visibility into software components and dependencies.
* **Policy Violations** – Export violations related to security, compliance, and operational policies.
* **Operational Risk** – Assess the **stability, maintenance, and lifecycle** of software components.

***

### **How to Export Scan Results**

1. Navigate to the **scan result screen** in Xray.
2. Click the **\[...] (More Options) button**.
3. Select **"Export Scan Data"** and choose the desired **export type**.

***

### **Types of Scan Result Exports**

#### **1. Security Export**

The **Security Export** report provides details about detected vulnerabilities in scanned artifacts.

**Included Fields:**

* **CVE ID** – Unique identifier for the vulnerability.
* **Severity** – The standard **CVSS-based severity rating**.
* **JFrog Research Severity** – Adjusted severity based on **JFrog’s advanced security research**.
* **Component Physical Path** – The exact location of the affected component.
* **Infected Component** – The specific package or library impacted.
* **Infected Version** – The version of the affected component.
* **Edited Time** – The timestamp of the latest scan result update.
* **Applicability** _(For JFrog Advanced Security Users)_ – Indicates whether the vulnerability is **actually exploitable** in real-world scenarios.

***

#### **2. Legal Compliance Report**

This report provides an overview of **software licenses** associated with your components, including **internally detected** and **externally enriched** licenses.

**Included Fields:**

* **Component Name** – Name of the software component.
* **Licenses** – Detected open-source licenses associated with the component.
* **License Links** – Links to legal references for each license.
* **Package Type** – The software package format (e.g., npm, Maven, PyPI).
* **Component ID** – A unique identifier for the component.
* **Package ID** – The ID of the package in the repository.
* **Version** – The specific version of the component.

***

#### **3. Violations Report**

The **Violations Report** provides a detailed list of **policy violations** associated with the **SCA (Software Composition Analysis) scan** of an artifact.

**Included Fields:**

✔ **Violation Summary** – A brief description of the policy violation.\
✔ **Severity** – Risk level of the violation (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical).\
✔ **Violation Type** – The category of violation (e.g., Security, License, Operational Risk).\
✔ **Watch Name** – The policy scope applied to the violation.\
✔ **Component Physical Path** – Location of the affected artifact.\
✔ **Component** – The specific component that triggered the violation.\
✔ **Created Date** – Timestamp of when the violation was detected.\
✔ **Policy Triggered** – The policy rule that caused the violation.\
✔ **Applicability** _(For JFrog Advanced Security Users)_ – Indicates whether the violation is **applicable in the current environment**.

***

#### **4. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) Report**

The **SBOM report** provides a **comprehensive inventory** of software components and dependencies. This report helps organizations:\
✔ **Understand software composition** and dependencies.\
✔ **Gain visibility into open-source licenses** and compliance requirements.\
✔ **Identify outdated components** or software reaching end-of-life.\
✔ **Detect vulnerable components** and recently disclosed CVEs.\
✔ **Enforce software security policies** based on risk factors.

**How to Export an SBOM Report**

After an **Xray scan**, you can export an **SBOM report** using one of two industry-standard formats:

#### **Supported SBOM Formats**

**1. SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)**

SPDX is an industry-standard format for **communicating software components and license metadata**.\
✔ Useful for **license management** and **compliance tracking**.\
✔ Supports **open-source compliance reporting**.

**SPDX Export Formats:**

* **Tag:Value**
* **JSON**
* **XLSX (Excel format)**

**2. CycloneDX**

CycloneDX is a **lightweight SBOM format** designed for **software security and risk analysis**.\
✔ Focuses on **security, vulnerability tracking, and exploitability**.\
✔ As of **Xray version 3.67.x and above**, CycloneDX SBOMs also include **VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange)** data, providing:

* **Vulnerability details**
* **Exploitability status**
* **Technical analysis of risks**

**CycloneDX Export Formats:**

* **JSON**
* **XML**

***

#### **Conclusion**

Exporting scan results in Xray allows organizations to **gain deep security insights**, **enforce compliance**, and **track vulnerabilities** effectively. By leveraging **Security, Compliance, Violations, and SBOM reports**, teams can improve **software supply chain security** and **regulatory compliance** while ensuring **operational resilience**.
