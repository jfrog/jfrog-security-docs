# Runtime

JFrog Runtime Security provides real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and automated remediation for vulnerabilities in running applications. It ensures that software artifacts, containers, and workloads remain secure in dynamic environments like Kubernetes.

#### **Business Needs for JFrog Curation**

With the rise of cloud-native architectures, organizations face an increasing number of security threats at runtime. Traditional security measures, such as static analysis and pre-deployment scanning, are insufficient to protect against active threats. Businesses need a solution that continuously monitors runtime environments, detects anomalies, and prevents potential breaches before they cause damage.

**Key Business Needs:**

* Continuous security enforcement for running workloads.
* Visibility into runtime vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* Automated remediation to prevent security threats from escalating.
* Compliance with security policies and industry regulations.
* Seamless integration with DevOps workflows.

#### **Purpose of JFrog Runtime Security**

JFrog Runtime Security is designed to provide organizations with:

* **Real-time threat detection** – Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities as they emerge in production.
* **Live assessment of workloads** – Ensuring that applications and infrastructure remain secure throughout their lifecycle.
* **Actionable security insights** – Allowing teams to make informed decisions on security risks.
* **Automated security enforcement** – Blocking untrusted or malicious artifacts from running in protected environments.

By implementing JFrog Runtime Security, organizations can ensure that their applications operate safely, efficiently, and in compliance with security best practices.

#### **Key Issues JFrog Runtime Resolves**

| **Lack of real-time threat detection**                         | Continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters and running processes for vulnerabilities. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Limited visibility into runtime risks**                      | Provides a centralized Risk Summary dashboard for quick issue identification.        |
| **Slow response to security incidents**                        | Enables automated remediation workflows to address threats immediately.              |
| **Untrusted or vulnerable artifacts running in production**    | Blocks execution of artifacts that do not meet security compliance policies.         |
| **Difficulty in tracing vulnerabilities back to their source** | Integrates with JFrog Artifactory to map issues to their origin.                     |
| **Managing security at scale**                                 | Deploys sensors to monitor multiple clusters in distributed environments.            |
| **Ensuring compliance with security policies**                 | Enforces security rules across CI/CD pipelines and live environments.                |

#### **Benefits of Using JFrog Runtime Security**

1. **Enhanced Security Posture** – Detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in real time, reducing the risk of breaches.
2. **Comprehensive Visibility** – Gain insights into runtime security risks with detailed dashboards and reports.
3. **Automated Risk Remediation** – Minimize manual security interventions by automating threat response.
4. **Seamless Integration** – Works natively with JFrog Artifactory and Xray for end-to-end security enforcement.
5. **Improved Compliance** – Enforce security policies that align with industry regulations and standards.
6. **Efficient Security Operations** – Reduce operational overhead by providing security teams with actionable intelligence.
7. **Scalability** – Supports large-scale Kubernetes deployments, ensuring security across multiple environments.

By implementing JFrog Runtime Security, organizations can protect their production environments from emerging threats, ensuring the continuous security and integrity of their software applications.
