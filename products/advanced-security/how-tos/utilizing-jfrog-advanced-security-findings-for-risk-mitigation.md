# Utilizing JFrog Advanced Security Findings for Risk Mitigation

**Scenario: Remediating a Critical Vulnerability in a Production Application**

A software company builds and deploys containerized applications using JFrog Artifactory and Kubernetes. During a routine security scan, **JFrog Advanced Security** detects a **critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-XXXXX) in OpenSSL**—a widely used cryptographic library—within a production-deployed container image.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive data, posing a significant security risk.



#### **How the DevOps & Security Teams Utilize JFrog Advanced Security Findings**

**1. Threat Detection & Prioritization**

* **JFrog Xray** automatically scans the application’s container images and identifies the OpenSSL vulnerability.
* The **JFrog Security Dashboard** displays:
  * The severity level (**Critical**)
  * Affected components (OpenSSL 1.1.1)
  * Exploitability status (public exploit available)
  * Suggested fixed version (OpenSSL 3.0.8)
* The team **prioritizes** this issue since it’s high severity and exploitable in their environment.

**2. Automated Policy Enforcement in CI/CD**

* The DevSecOps team has configured a **security policy** that blocks any artifact containing critical vulnerabilities from being promoted to production.
* If a developer attempts to build a new image with the vulnerable OpenSSL version, JFrog **automatically fails the build** and notifies them in Slack and Jira.

**3. Remediation & Fix Deployment**

* The security team assigns the issue to developers with **JFrog’s remediation guidance**, which recommends upgrading OpenSSL to **3.0.8**.
* Developers update the **Dockerfile** to use the secure OpenSSL version and commit the fix.
* The CI/CD pipeline triggers a new build, which JFrog scans again before allowing deployment.

**4. Retrospective Scanning & Incident Response**

* Since the vulnerability was found in an already deployed container, JFrog’s **retroactive scanning** triggers an alert.
* The security team **pulls a list of affected artifacts** using JFrog’s security reports and **traces impacted applications**.
* They **patch the running containers** by rolling out the updated image through their Kubernetes deployment pipeline.

**5. Compliance & Audit Reporting**

* After remediation, the team generates an **audit report** using JFrog’s compliance tools.
* This report is shared with security auditors to confirm the issue was resolved according to company policies and regulatory requirements (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).
