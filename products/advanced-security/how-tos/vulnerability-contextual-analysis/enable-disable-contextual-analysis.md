# Enable/Disable Contextual Analysis

Vulnerability Contextual Analysis is disabled by default for new artifacts in all resources marked for indexing by Xray.

Contextual Analysis is applied to new scans only, and not to existing scans. The analysis will run on indexed resources, however, it will not run on the Index Artifacts History. For more information, see [Indexing Xray Resources](https://about/document/preview/625776#UUID-edc92457-f62c-e873-a822-b6989c7c6d95).

Starting from Xray version 3.66.x and above, you can scan an existing artifact for Vulnerability Contextual Analysis.

1.  In Classic Navigation, navigate to the **Administration** module, go to **Xray** **Settings | General** and click **Indexed Resources**.

    In New Navigation, navigate to the **Administration** module, go to **Xray** **Settings** and click **Indexed Resources**.
2. Select the repository or build and select **Configure**.
3. Enable the **Vulnerability Contextual Analysis** option.
