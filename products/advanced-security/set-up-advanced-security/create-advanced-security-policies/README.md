# Create Advanced Security Policies

Security policies define rules based on security criteria, triggering automatic actions when the conditions are met. These policies are enforced when applied to [Xray Watches](../../../xray/features-and-capabilities/sdlc-policy-mangement/watches.md). To ensure effective security management, it is recommended to create policies that focus on specific types of violations based on your security requirements.&#x20;

Advanced Security allows you to enhance existing and newly created [Xray policies](../../../xray/features-and-capabilities/sdlc-policy-mangement/) with **Exposures** detection and **contextual analysis** rules.

Violations can be viewed in:

* The **Scans List**
* The **Watch Violations** page
