# Initiate Advanced Scans

When you enable Advanced Security for the first time, existing repositories and artifacts in Artifactory are **not** scanned automatically. You must manually trigger scans for the repositories and artifacts you want to analyze.

Once advanced scans are set up, they apply **only to newly added artifacts** and run as **ongoing, recurring scans**. However, you can also trigger **one-time scans** for an immediate, on-demand security analysis of your artifacts, containers, or codebases without waiting for scheduled scans.

The [Repositories](repositories.md) and [Artifacts](artifacts.md) guides explain how to initiate and configure both **ongoing** and **one-time** advanced scans to detect:

* **Vulnerabilities through Contextual Analysis**
* **Service risks**
* **Secrets exposure**
* **Application security issues**
