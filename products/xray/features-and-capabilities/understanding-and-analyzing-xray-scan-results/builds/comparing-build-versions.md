# Comparing Build Versions

This feature allows users to compare two versions of a scanned build and see the security differences between them, such as any new CVEs that have been introduced. With this feature you will be able to:

* Compare security posture between two build versions.
* Identify new CVEs introduced in the newer version.
* Get detailed information on each CVE including severity, description, and remediation.
* Proactively detect security regressions between build versions.
* Quickly identify and mitigate newly introduced vulnerabilities.

You can compare current build version against any previous version that was indexed by Xray.

**To compare build versions:**

1. In **Scans List**, navigate to the **Builds** tab.
2.  Select the Build, and in the Build Versions list, from the three dot menu on the right, select **Compare to Version**

    The compare dialog appears.
3. Select the version you want to compare from the drop-down.

The diff view appears. It will display the following:

*   Summary of security changes between the versions.

    CVEs that exist in one version, but not the other, are indicated as **Added.** CVEs that were fixed, are marked as **Resolved**
* Details on each CVE are displayed in the right pane when you click on the CVE
* CVEs that are not affected are hidden. Click **View Unchanged CVEs** on the bottom to view the full list.
* Filter the view by the selecting/deselecting **Added/Resolved** checkboxes.\
