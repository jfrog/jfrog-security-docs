#### Enable Advanced Scans <a href="#uuid-2258b633-4d22-d0eb-8c2e-4e3bea1c42b1" id="uuid-2258b633-4d22-d0eb-8c2e-4e3bea1c42b1"></a>

Advanced Scans are configured per repository. The repository must be indexed by Xray, for more information, see [Indexing Resources](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Indexing+Xray+Resources). Advanced Scans are applied on newly scanned artifacts only, and not on existing indexed artifacts. You can also run contextual analysis and exposures scans on an existing artifact. To learn more about it, see [Exposures Scans](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Exposures+Scanning+Categories) and [Contextual Analysis](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Vulnerability+Contextual+Analysis).
