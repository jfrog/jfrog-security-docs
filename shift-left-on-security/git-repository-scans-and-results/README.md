# Git Repository Scans and Results

After running a Frogbot scan on your Git repository, the results are available in the JFrog platform **Scans List** page, under the **Commits** tab or the **PR**. This centralized view allows you to review Secrets, SAST, and vulnerabilities discovered in your repository and its dependencies.&#x20;

For a deeper explanation on how to read, interpret, and act on scan results, including policy violations and SBOM details, refer to the [Understanding and Analyzing Xray Scan Results](../../products/xray/features-and-capabilities/sca/understanding-and-analyzing-xray-scan-results/) section.
