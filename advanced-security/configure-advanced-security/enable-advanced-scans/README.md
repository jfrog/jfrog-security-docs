# Enable Advanced Scans

The [Repositories](../../../products/advanced-security/configure-advanced-security/initiate-advanced-scans/repositories.md) and [Artifacts](../../../products/advanced-security/configure-advanced-security/initiate-advanced-scans/artifacts.md) guides explain how to initiate and configure both **ongoing** and **one-time** advanced scans to detect:

* **Vulnerabilities through Contextual Analysis**
* **Service risks**
* **Secrets exposure**
* **Application security issues**

* [Repository Advanced Scans](https://jfrog.com/help/r/xray-rest-apis/repository-advanced-scans/)
* [Get Repository Advanced Scan Status](https://jfrog.com/help/r/xray-rest-apis/get-repository-advanced-scan-status)
