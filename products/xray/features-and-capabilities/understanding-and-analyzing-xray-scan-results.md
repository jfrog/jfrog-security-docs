# Understanding and Analyzing Xray Scan Results

### **Overview**

Xray scans your **artifacts, builds, and repositories** for **vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and security risks**. Once a scan is completed, Xray provides a **detailed report** with identified issues, their severity, affected components, and possible remediation steps.

This guide will help you **navigate, interpret, and act upon scan results** effectively.

***

### **Where to Find Xray Scan Results?**

Xray scan results can be accessed in **multiple locations** depending on the scope of the scan:

#### **1. Viewing Scan Results for an Artifact**

* Navigate to **JFrog Platform** ‚Üí **Artifactory**.
* Select the **repository** containing the artifact.
* Click on the **artifact** you want to analyze.
* Go to the **Xray Data** tab to see vulnerability and license reports.

#### **2. Viewing Scan Results for a Build**

* Navigate to **Builds** ‚Üí Select the build name.
* Click the **Xray Violations** tab.
* View a summary of security and license issues detected in the build‚Äôs dependencies.

#### **3. Viewing Scan Results for a Repository**

* Go to **Xray** ‚Üí **Security & Compliance** ‚Üí **Scans**.
* Select the repository from the list.
* Click on it to view **all detected vulnerabilities and compliance violations**.

***

### **Understanding Xray Scan Results**

#### **1. Overview of the Scan Summary**

The **Xray Scan Dashboard** provides a high-level summary of issues found in the scanned entity. It includes:\
‚úÖ **Total Number of Issues** detected.\
‚úÖ **Severity Breakdown** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).\
‚úÖ **Types of Violations** (Security, License, or Operational).

***

#### **2. Security Violations Tab**

This tab displays all detected **security vulnerabilities** affecting your scanned artifacts.

| Field                  | Description                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CVE ID**             | Unique identifier for the vulnerability (e.g., `CVE-2023-12345`).                |
| **Severity**           | Categorized as **Critical, High, Medium, or Low**.                               |
| **Impacted Component** | The specific artifact or dependency that is affected (e.g., `log4j-2.14.1.jar`). |
| **Description**        | Explains the nature of the vulnerability and its potential impact.               |
| **Fix Available**      | Indicates if a patched version exists and provides an upgrade recommendation.    |

**Example Security Violation**

```
vbnetCopyEditCVE: CVE-2023-45678  
Severity: Critical  
Component: log4j:2.14.1  
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.  
Fix Available: Upgrade to log4j:2.17.1  
```

‚úÖ **Recommended Actions:**

* If a **fix is available**, upgrade to the latest secure version.
* If a **fix is not available**, apply security mitigations (e.g., firewall rules, dependency patching).
* If it‚Äôs a **false positive**, request an **exception** from the security team.

***

#### **3. License Compliance Tab**

This tab provides a list of **licenses** associated with scanned artifacts. It helps identify **restricted or unapproved licenses** that may pose legal risks.

| Field                 | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package Name**      | The artifact containing the license.                              |
| **License Type**      | The detected license (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0).            |
| **Compliance Status** | ‚úÖ **Compliant** or ‚ùå **Non-Compliant** based on company policies. |

**Example License Violation**

```
vbnetCopyEditComponent: openssl-1.0.1  
License: OpenSSL License  
Status: ‚ùå Restricted (not allowed for commercial distribution)  
Action: Replace with an alternative package or obtain legal approval.  
```

‚úÖ **Recommended Actions:**

* **For restricted licenses**: Obtain legal approval or find an alternative package.
* **For missing licenses**: Ensure the package includes a valid license declaration.

***

#### **4. Impact Analysis Tab**

The **Impact Analysis** section shows how detected vulnerabilities **affect other components in the software environment**.

**Key Insights:**

* Which **artifacts and builds** are impacted?
* Which **projects or microservices** use the vulnerable component?
* Which **environments** (Dev, Staging, Production) are at risk?

‚úÖ **Recommended Actions:**

* If the issue impacts **multiple projects**, coordinate a cross-team fix.
* Prioritize fixes based on **production vs. development** environments.
* Use **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** to track vulnerable dependencies.

***

### **Filtering and Sorting Scan Results for Better Analysis**

Xray provides **filters** to help narrow down scan results for better prioritization.

#### **1. Filter by Severity**

* **Critical & High**: Prioritize immediate remediation.
* **Medium & Low**: Monitor but don‚Äôt necessarily block deployment.

#### **2. Filter by Component Name**

Search for vulnerabilities affecting a specific package (e.g., `log4j`).

#### **3. Filter by Policy Violations**

* Show only vulnerabilities that **violate predefined security policies**.

***

### **Taking Action on Scan Results**

#### **1. Fixing Vulnerabilities**

* **Upgrade** vulnerable dependencies if a fix is available.
* **Apply security patches** if upgrading is not feasible.
* **Request an exception** for false positives or justified risks.

#### **2. Handling License Issues**

* Replace **restricted licenses** with compliant alternatives.
* Obtain **legal approvals** for specific cases.

#### **3. Exporting and Sharing Reports**

* Click **"Export Report"** ‚Üí Select format **CSV, JSON, or PDF**.
* Share with **security, DevOps, and compliance teams** for risk assessment.

***

### **Automating Scan Analysis in CI/CD Pipelines**

üìå **Goal:** Automatically fail builds with critical security issues.

#### **1. Configure Xray Scans in Jenkins**

Modify Jenkinsfile to trigger Xray scans:

```sh
shCopyEditjfrog rt build-scan my-app-build 42
```

‚úÖ **Expected Outcome:**

* **Build fails** if Critical vulnerabilities are detected.
* **Scan report is logged** in the CI/CD pipeline output.

#### **2. Sending Security Alerts for Critical Issues**

Configure real-time notifications for security teams:

```sh
shCopyEditcurl -X POST "https://artifactory.example.com/api/xray/notifications" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "watch_name": "Critical Vulnerabilities",
           "notify": "security-team@example.com"
         }'
```

‚úÖ **Expected Outcome:**

* **Email and Slack alerts** sent for critical vulnerabilities.
* **Security team can act immediately** to mitigate risks.

***

### **Postconditions**

* Security and license violations **are reviewed and mitigated**.
* CI/CD pipelines **enforce security policies automatically**.
* Compliance teams **receive reports for audits and legal review**.

***

### **Alternative Flows & Considerations**

* **Historical Scan Data**: View previous scans to identify trends.
* **Custom Policy Rules**: Adjust Xray policies based on business needs.
* **SBOM Tracking**: Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for transparency.

***

### **Business Impact**

üîπ **Prevents security vulnerabilities from reaching production**.\
üîπ **Ensures legal compliance with licensing policies**.\
üîπ **Reduces risk exposure by proactively fixing issues**.
